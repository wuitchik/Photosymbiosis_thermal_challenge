# Photosymbiosis lessens the environmental stress response under a heat challenge in a facultatively symbiotic coral

This is the accompanying repository for the experiment where different symbiotic states of Astrangia poculata were exposed to three temperature treatments: i) control (static 18°C), ii) heat challenge (increasing from 18 to 32°C over 15 days), and iii) cold challenge (decreasing from 18 to 6°C over 15 days) after which coral gene expression was profiled.
